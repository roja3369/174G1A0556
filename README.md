In this study we have erformed classification methodologies to find out the overfitting in HSI.
Hyper Spectral Image(HSI) provides a wide range of spectral information that can be used to address a variety of problems like crop analysis, geological mapping, mineral exploration, etc. Hyper Spectral Images are the images in which one continuous spectrum is measured for each pixel.


Hyper Spectral Images does have some training data samples which causes over fitting. In order to overcome this problem we are improving the accuracy in training data sets by using CROSS-VALIDATION . The Training data set is artificially increased by adding training samples that have been interpolated from the original training data . Hence, by applying the cross validation and data augmentation to the existing datasets, overcomes over fitting problem and improves the classification accuracy.
